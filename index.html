            Since we’re looking for exceptional talent from around the world, 
            we will do everything we can to make your transition as easy as possible.</h2>
          <p class="sixth__sec__p">If you're joining us in Berlin, we'll help with relocation and paperwork. 
            We’ll even provide you with free German or English lessons. 
            Plus, working in Germany means you can expect comprehensive health insurance for you and your family, 
            as well as generous maternity and paternity leave. Office hours are flexible, 
            but it’s not all work; we have several company and team outings throughout the year 
            as well as a variety of fun, informal small-group activities.</p>
